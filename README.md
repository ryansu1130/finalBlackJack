## Project Idea

The scope of this project is to develop a casino with table games and slots. We are only able to
implement Blackjack due to time constraints. As for now, the project idea will just be Blackjack.

## Objective

Kaami Co. aims to be the first “Online Casino” to be fully legal and operational in the United
States. We are still in beta testing while we develop our website and algorithms. Amid strict
COVID restrictions and proper social distancing, Kaami Co. will offer individuals with the
temptations of going to a casino the ability to legally gamble at the comfort of their own homes!
We currently only offer Blackjack and will have plans on adding more floor games such as
Roulette, Slots, and Poker.

## Guide

#### Main Page

Upon entering our website, you will be greeted with a cosmic-themed website page that serves as
the main page of our website. There is a navigation bar that leads to their respective directories
along with a real-time balance that reflects the user’s balance. In the nav-bar, you will see our
Kaami Co. logo. Moving along the bar, there is a “How to Play” button where we currently hold the
page to teach our visitors the game of Blackjack. We welcome all users of all backgrounds to join
our adventure to expand the idea of “Online Gambling”. In the future, this directory will be replaced
with the games that we continue to add. The “about us” button will open a modal with a bio about
our developers and our company’s story and ambition. The settings button will open a modal with
music and sound FX sliders to set to your preference. We also implemented a dark mode for the
website for users who prefer to not be blinded by white light.


Moving down the web-page, there are two cards that serve as the game directories. Currently, you
see two directories but only the Blackjack card will work. The blackjack card should be the only
one that works. The other card will hold the game that we are currently developing. We are proud
of what we have in the coming future.

#### Blackjack Page

Our blackjack page consists of a mix of art and animations. You will be playing a fully operational
blackjack game that is built by our finest developers. In the game, you are able to bet chips
denominated from your balance. Players are subject to win, lose, or push in each respective
scenario whilst playing our Blackjack game. Cards are shuffled and dealt accordingly, to the rules
of Blackjack. There are multiple decks of cards in each case of cards. The game will not be limited
to just a standard 52 card deck. Dealers are subject to abide by the standard US Casino rules of
having to continuously hit until the dealer’s hands are 17 or greater. The player has complete
freedom of their actions on each hand.
